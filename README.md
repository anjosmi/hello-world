# hello-world

Hey there!

Hope you are not looking for documentation or great notes at this time. :^) Testing few features here and having fun while doing it.

A little bit about myself... I'm a Software Engineer living in New York City. Far away from my South America/Brazilian roots. I work at HBC Digital with an incredible team, building software to enhance and give a great look to our websites.
