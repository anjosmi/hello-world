## Question1

Specification:
- Write a function that breaks up a string of words with no spaces into a string with the appropriate spaces.
Say that you have a string "helloworld", this program will split it into a sentence "hello world".

Questions you may ask to clarify expectations and finalize your method signature:
- What if I have an empty String?
- What if there are more than 2 words?
- What if there are only numbers?
- What if there is an empty String?
- What if the words are not spelled correctly?


## Question2

Specification:
- Write a function that will find duplicate number in an array.
Say that you have an array with elements 1,3,5,6,3,6,7,10. This program will return only duplicate elements 3,6.


## Question3

Specification:
- Write a function that will revert a String.
Say that you have a String "dlroW olleH". This program will return "Hello World".


## Question4

Specification:
- Write a function that will clean all duplicate numbers in an array.
Say that you have an array with elements 1,3,5,6,3,6,7,10. This program will return only duplicate elements 1,3,5,6,7,10.


## Question5

Specification:
- Write a function that finds a given string inside a list of elements.
